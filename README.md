MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE

As Canada’s Federal Public Service (PS) adapts to the rise
of the gig economy and project-based work as a new
reality, it requires a shift in how it recognizes talent.

Project-based work will have a transformative effect on the
way we work, how we’re organized, how we communicate
and ultimately, what it means to work and build
connections with multiple employers and teams of people.

How we record, connect and validate our skills, learning
experiences and reputation to these ever-revolving
networks will be essential to skill discovery, job mobility,
social capital and well-being.

How can individuals demonstrate to employers what they know, what they are cable of? 
That their learning, knowledge and experiences are credible? 
That the claims about their professional history can be trusted?

The current reality:

Data is locked in silos 
Work related data such as work history, achievements, exam results, records of learning, security clearance level and reference check results are currently stored in multiple closed HR networks with limited visibility, discoverability and interoperability. 

Repeated and inconsistent interpretations of data  
For each new hiring process there are multiple re-verifications of data by different stakeholders sometimes with inconsistent interpretations (e.g. meets/does not meet).  In the case of credentials, repeated verification of transcripts are often required.

Data  ownership  
Individuals have limited “ownership” and control over who has access to their work related information.

Data is not dynamic  
No easy way exists to record, showcase and validate a real-time account of ever-evolving skills, knowledge, abilities, learning experiences, accomplishments and work related peer networks.
